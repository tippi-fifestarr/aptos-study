### 6. [Aligned Hackathon Themes](./aligned_hackathon_themes.md)
A mapping of our insights to the official Aptos Hackathon Themes document:
- Specific technical implementations for each theme using Aptos's unique features
- Code snippets from Eman's notes relevant to each theme
- Detailed implementation highlights for all ten official project ideas
- Technical advantages of using Aptos for each project category

### 7. [Changes Based on Follow-up Feedback](./changes.md)
A summary of key changes needed based on Eman's follow-up conversation:
- CLI and development environment issues
- Learning process insights
- Oracle integration clarifications
- Dependency management challenges
- Clean project command issues

## Key Cross-Cutting Themes

Throughout Eman's feedback and study notes, several important themes emerged:

1. **Resource Visibility**
   > "When we are hacking, we become blind. So, like, the thing is in front of our eyes and we don't see..."

   Developers need highly visible, accessible resources during hackathons when cognitive load is high.

2. **Example-First Learning**
   > "The first thing I always look for is kind of like the examples they have, because I might go and take the code and tweak it."

   Providing working code examples that can be easily adapted is crucial for rapid development.

3. **Ecosystem-Appropriate Terminology**
   > "When you are introducing stuff and giving the analogy in Solana or giving the analogy in EVM, use their own words."

   Using familiar terminology when explaining Aptos concepts helps developers build mental bridges.

4. **Interactive Learning Components**
   > "If you have this kind of interactive flowchart where I can click here and know the tools, that would be easier for me."

   Interactive components significantly enhance the learning experience, especially under time pressure.

5. **Theory-First, Implementation-Second Learning Style**
   > "I'm kind of person who love to understand the theory, the theoretical part. So whenever I'm stuck, I know exactly what I'm doing."

   Many experienced developers prefer to understand concepts thoroughly before implementation.

6. **CLI and Development Environment Challenges**
   > "The CLI template is horrible... it should be with at least the required files"

   Ambiguous compilation results and template limitations create friction for developers.

7. **Dependency Management Issues**
   > "I had problem when I was trying to integrate Pyth Oracle things because they are using specific commit and I was trying to get the latest Aptos framework and there's a conflict there."

   Version conflicts between packages cause significant time loss during hackathons.

## Implementation Priorities

Based on the comprehensive insights, here are the recommended implementation priorities:

1. **Enhance the Decision Tree** with interactive elements and Aptos-specific feature highlights

2. **Create Ecosystem-Specific Migration Guides** for EVM and Solana developers

3. **Develop Concrete Project Templates** for each hackathon theme, ensuring they include all required files

4. **Improve Resource Discoverability** with visual highlighting and better organization

5. **Add More Working Code Examples** that can be easily copied and modified

6. **Create CLI Troubleshooting Guide** to address ambiguous compilation results and dependency issues

7. **Document Common Integration Challenges** especially for Oracle integrations and dependency management

These insights provide a solid foundation for enhancing the Aptos Hackathon Quickstart to better serve participants and help them build innovative projects that leverage Aptos's unique capabilities.
